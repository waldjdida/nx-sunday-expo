# ✨ Nx-Sunday-Expo ✨

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This is to help those having issues adding expo modules to a react project already created using `react-native init`

To run use: 
```sh
yarn android
```



Using android emulator, you should be able to see a button Open a web browser which is using `expo-web-browser` to open the link

The last 2 commits should give you an indication to what's needed to be added/modified in your project
